<b style="font-size: 22px;">Motivation:</b> 
<p style="font-size: 18px; display: inline; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Robotic Manipulators have seen widespread use in the recent years mainly because of the need to automate manufacturing units and warehouses. Even more, the use of multiple arms at once has seen great potential, the simplest example being the use of humanoid, which often require the synchronized movement of multiple limbs to perform complex tasks.

<p style="font-size: 18px; display: inline; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Currently there has been research which focuses on improving the efficiency of coordination among multiple robotic arms. Particularly there are methods which improve speed and scalibility, particularly in cluttered environments <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00143'>Link </a>. However adapting these methods to ensure real-time responsiveness in dynamic environments remains a challenge.

<b style="font-size: 22px;">Problem Statement:</b> 
<p style="font-size: 18px; display: inline; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The problem boils down to one question - <b>How to generate fast solutions to enable real-time operation?</b>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; display: inline; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The aim of this work is to develop an algorithm which can generate motion planning solutions for multiple arms in constant-time in online scenarios. This is achieved by pre-computing data structures and leveraging them during online search.
