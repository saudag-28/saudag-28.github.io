<b style="font-size: 22px;">Motivation:</b> 
<p style="font-size: 18px; display: inline; margin-bottom: 20px;">
There is work being done on training local locomotion ML policies
for complex robots which require non-trivial controllers. These local locomotion policies avoid obstacles while also handling uneven terrain to reach a local way-point. This work focuses on applying these local policies for multiple robots sharing the same workspace. The main objective is to apply Multi-agent path finding algorithms (MAPF) along with pre-trained local policies to plan collision free paths for quadrupeds working collaboratively.

<b style="font-size: 22px;">Problem Statement:</b> 
<p style="font-size: 18px; display: inline; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The problem boils down to one question - <b>How to leverage these pre-trained policies to reduce constraints in a multi-agent path finding algorithm.</b>
