I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute majoring in Robotic Systems Development.

Before joining CMU, my professional endeavors primarily revolved around integrating sub-systems for a mobile robot and developing ROS-based software.
At CMU, my focus is on acquiring a profound understanding of the critical elements that contribute to the autonomy of robotic systems and advancing my research in the realm of safe autonomy.
This motivation led me to enroll in the **Planning and Decision-Making in Robotics** course instructed by Prof. Maxim Likhachev. This course exposed me to a diverse array of algorithmic techniques employed in the planning and decision-making processes in robotics, providing an opportunity to implement these algorithms using C++.

Moving forward, I plan to delve deeper into exploring methodologies for designing **safe human-robot interaction models.**
