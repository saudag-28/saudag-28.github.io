I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute majoring in Robotics. I work in Search-based Planning Laboratory advised by <a href='https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/maxim-likhachev/'>Dr. Maxim Likhachev.

My research interests lie in planning and decision-making for multi-agent systems. Currently I am exploring heuristic based search methods to solve the multi-agent problem. Later I intend to explore learning based methods.

Before joining CMU, my professional endeavors primarily revolved around integrating sub-systems for a mobile robot and developing ROS-based software.
I have worked extensively on integrating hardware for the robot and implementing ros-based packages on nvidia processors for various applications.

Moving forward, I plan to delve deeper into exploring methodologies for designing **safe human-robot interaction models.**
