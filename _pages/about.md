I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute majoring in Robotic Systems Development. I am particularly interested in working on **motion planning** algorithms for a robot.

Prior to joining CMU, I worked in the robotics department of TIH-IoT, IIT Bombay. My work here focused on developing a localization stack for a four-wheeled robot. Apart from this, I worked on a visual-servoing problem that used a depth camera to navigate the robot across crop rows (for a detailed description, got to <a href='http://127.0.0.1:4000/projects/'>Projects</a> section).
